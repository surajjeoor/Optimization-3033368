For these random walks, hill climbing is performed. If it finds local maxima which is greater than considered at first glance, it replaces with the new one.\n",

And the Most important attribute which i am using for fitness score determination that will be explained is : \"no_node\" which is nothing but the maximium number of nodes or stores that particular vehicle can visit. For Vans, it is 12 as I am assuming both warehouses are sharing 3 vans. Hence 3 Vans multiplied by the maximum number of stores each van can visit i.e. 4, which is equal to 12.

        "<b>Conclusions</b>\n",
        "It is hard being an international student to find efficient distances and routes manually, especially if you have friends living in the different corners of the nation. For such problems brute force becomes very handy as the number of nodes are low. In the above problem there were only 6 cities and there are 720(i.e. 6!) number of solutions available. The time elapsed for solution finding was nearly one milliseconds. The merit of the algorithm is it will give an accurate solution. The main disadvantage of the brute force algorithm is it will take a lot of time to process as the number of nodes increase. If we take the number of possibilities,nodes i.e. cities, and elapsed time in consideration, all of them are proportionally related. As the number of nodes increased, the number of solutions increased which soars the processing time. For instance if I take more than 20 nodes i.e. cities in consideration, there will be 2432902008176640000 numbers of possibilities. By the processor I am using, If I take the elapsed time for 6 cities in consideration and implement the same solution for 20 cities, it will take 4.388x10^15 milliseconds which is roughly a hundred thousand years.\n",
